    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Eggs can liven up a meal in many ways, served in different styles all over the world. 
        In Malaysia, eggs have been served creatively in many ways, accompanying classic meals beloved by many now. 
        For instance, we have egg sambal, which combines the delicious heaty kick of a spicy sauteed paste with sliced hard-boiled eggs. 
        Leftover eggs cooked for nasi lemak or earned from weddings are not wasted if you whip up this recipe to be eaten with rice the next day. 
        Some home cooks also love to include eggs in dishes with vegetables, such as asparagus with salted eggs or stir-fried long beans with eggs.</p>
